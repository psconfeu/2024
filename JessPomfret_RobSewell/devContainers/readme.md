# Next Level PowerShell Development with Dev Containers and GitHub Codespaces

This session goes straight into the pivotal question:

'What is the ideal environment for crafting PowerShell scripts?"

While not a novel concept at PSConfEU, we're taking a fresh approach, diverging from past PSConfEU discussions. Our focus? The anatomy of a Dev Container, its customization potential, and integrating essential extensions and settings. This isn't just about streamlining your workflow; it's about creating a unified development experience accessible to every team member.

Our mission extends beyond technical mastery. As devoted community contributors, we aim to dismantle entry barriers, making it effortless for newcomers to join and thrive in our coding community. Dev Containers stand as our tool of choice in this endeavour.

But that's just the beginning. We'll elevate our discussion from local setups to the cloud, showcasing the power of GitHub Codespaces. Imagine accessing your development environment from any web browser, anywhere, even without your laptop. That's the flexibility and freedom we offer.

Embark on this journey with two seasoned MVPs. We're not just presenting a session but guiding you through a transformative experience. By the end, you'll be convinced: Developing PowerShell in Dev Containers, augmented by GitHub Codespaces, isn't just efficient â€“ it's the future.
